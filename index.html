        <p>Gaming may seem like a useless, health rotting activity that makes you violent, but in reality video games can be very helpful. One reason I like video games so much is actually the first reason, they confort you. when i'm alone, I like to play video games as the sound conforts me. Another reason is that they intertain me. Picture this, your in your room, you don't have anything to do, play outside, it's raining, draw, your out of paper, a video game can easily entertain you in a situation like this.</p>
